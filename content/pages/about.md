I am a Software and Product Developer at the [Greenbone Networks
GmbH](http://www.greenbone.net) in Osnabrück, Germany. My main focus is to
develop the operating system based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) for our
products and the open source core utility [OpenVAS](http://openvas.org/).

Apart from this I am interested in several other open source software projects,
space travel, mathematics, boxing and network policy.

Also I like penguins.

Not all articles in this blog are from myself, since I like also publish for
other people who have to say something interesting
